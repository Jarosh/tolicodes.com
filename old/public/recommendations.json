This led us to work with Toli in a more official capacity where he helped us architect a system that is now a main component of our data product. I can't recommend Toli enough. He is quick to adapt and understand our problems and is always accommodating in terms of scheduling appointments (because hours can get pretty weird in start-ups)! If you want someone who won't run your billables and get results quickly, you should reach out to Toli. My only regret is that we don't have more projects for Toli to help us out on.",

I speak with developers everyday and not many can articulate like the way he does. He is a true problem solver. Anatoliy is articulate and passionate about programming. I work with some of the best developers in NYC and he is more knowledgeable than many top developers who have been in the arena many more yrs than he has. Although he is more experienced with PHP, he can pick up any language. I was surprised by his knowledge about SDLC and agile mythologies. Most people just like to say they work in agile but do not know what they are talking about. This is not the case for Anatoliy. He is a problem solver and a quick learner. I hope him best of luck.
